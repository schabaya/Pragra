There are three types of flow control statements in java
                1. Selection/conditional Statements: based on a particular condition the selected block will executed.
                        if
                        if-else
                        else-if
                        switch

                2. Iteration/Looping statements: The same code will be repeated multiple times.
                        for
                        for-each (introduced in 1.5 version)
                        while
                        do-while

                3. Transfer/Jumping statements
                        break
                        continue
                        goto
                        try
                        return
                        assert ( introduced in 1.4 version )



                1. Selection/conditional Statements: based on a particular condition the selected block will executed.
                        if
                        if-else

                            //Case 1:

                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                int age = 10;
                                if (age > 20) {
                                    System.out.println("Eligible for marriage");
                                } else {
                                    System.out.println("NOT eligible for marriage");
                                }
                            }
                        }


                        else-if
                        switch
